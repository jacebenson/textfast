# TextFast
Have you aver felt boring in typing longs and tedious words or sentences every time when you want to reply a chat or created a post in reddit? This is addon is for you, it helps you type fast in a very customizable way in the browser.

You can create shortcuts for words, setences or emoji and then type them in browser and write really fast. 
For instance: you can transform the phrase "I'm comming" into a shortcut "imc" and every time you time "imc" you will get "I'm comming". Another one? You can transform "¯\_[ツ]_/¯" into "shrug" and then you will never mess up with the characters ever again. 

All you have to do is to enter in the configuration page (click in the icon) and create a unique style of writing to you and then, save it and that is it. 

Good Luck, Have fun (typed: glhf)

## Why?

Well, I'm lazy to type and I don't like to type too much, so I want to be able to type fast even in the Firefox and all the websites that I use.


## Configuration

When you installed the addon, it will add a new icon to the top bar, click there and you will be in the "configuration page" (I'll improve that, I hope, I'm not very good at design). Then, click in the "+" (plus) icon and it will create a new row in the list. Now, in the "Replace" column you will put shortcut to your boring word, sentence or emoji and in the "With" you will put the real word/sentence/emoji and then, click in Save. That is it, now go to google and just test it and then, add more shortcuts.  

### Import 

Well, that it for the advanced users or the ones that exported the list from other installation (for who exported the list, you actually don have to change a thing, just import it, you can skip it). For those who don't want to add shortcut for shortcut, you can create a [JSON file](/example.json) following this example with your words and just import it and **save** it.

## Browsers

For now, I'm only focusing in the Firefox + webext. But, it will be cool to port it to others browsers and that is a good idea. 

## TODO

- [ ] Support dynamic inputs;
- [ ] Support non-usual way to enter a text; 
- [ ] Improve the UI of the list;
- [ ] Use a better icon;
- [ ] Sync your list with all your browsers;
- [ ] Change the name (maybe).

## Do you want to help?

Well, see the TODO list and talk to me, I'm open for new ideas.
